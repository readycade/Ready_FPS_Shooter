#### First Person + Third Person Shooter from Scratch!

With help from other Godot developer's YouTube Tutorials and Free 3D Models from Sketchfab.

Textures created with ComfyUI and/or taken by me, personally and run through various workflows to create PBR Albedo, Ambient Occlusion, Roughness, Curvature, Height and Normal Maps, Upscale, ect...

If I used anything from any other developers, it's covered under MIT License.
Public Domain images used for textures and/or offered FREE from YouTube devs.

(These should all just be placeholders and will be changed before Final Release)
